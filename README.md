# Dynamic Smart Form ðŸ§ 

## Description
This project was developed as part of a **training program at Dev Wave**.  
It is a **dynamic React form** built with **Vite** and **Material UI**, including **20 input fields** with **dynamic validation** handled with minimal code.  
The form automatically **resets** after successful submission.

---

## Features
- Dynamic generation of all form fields from a single **configuration array** (`formFields.js`).
- Single **generic validation function** for all fields (`validateField`).
- Input types include: text, email, number, password, date, tel, url, etc.
- **Material UI** components for professional design and responsive layout.
- Form clears automatically after submission.
- Easy to **add, remove, or modify fields** without touching validation logic.
- Modular structure for **maintainable and reusable code**.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mariam-Huussein/Smart-Form.git
cd smart-form
Install dependencies:

npm install


Run the development server:

npm run dev


Open the URL shown in the terminal (usually http://localhost:5173/).

How It Works

Form Fields: All fields are defined in formFields.js as an array of objects with properties like name, type, label, required, minLength, pattern, etc.

Dynamic Rendering: DynamicForm.jsx maps over this array to render all fields using the reusable FormField component.

Validation: validateField checks each field according to its configuration. Errors are displayed below each input using MUIâ€™s helperText.

Submission: On submit, the form validates all inputs, logs the data to the console if valid, and then resets the form for new input.

Tech Stack

JavaScript ES6+

CSS (optional for custom styling)

Advantages

Minimal repetitive code.

Highly maintainable and scalable.
